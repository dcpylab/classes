# Resources - Installing Python

During class we'll frequently use the command line and a text editor, and it helps if you have these installed beforehand. 


## First, the Command Line

When learning Python you'll probably come across many references to the Command Line. What is it? How do you use it?

The answers to many of these questions can be found [here](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything). On Mac or Linux you're already set with Terminal or bash. Many versions of Windows come with Powershell, but you can also download it [here.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42554)


## Installing Python

### Basic, Easy Installation with Anaconda

Anaconda is an easy to install software pacakge for Windows, Mac and Linux. It comes with many of the frequent tools and modules that many novice python developers use.

Download it here:

### Advanced Installation

**Windows**
Windows requires you to install Python, which can be confusing if you're new to programming. Below are a few guides to help you through the process:

* [How-to-Geek's Guide to Installing Python](http://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/), which includes screen shots documenting the steps, if you prefer visual guides.

* [The official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html#installing-python), which has a couple helpful links.

**Mac**

Python comes pre-installed with OSX. All you need to do is open the Terminal application (found in Utilities or use Spotlight search) and type the following:

'''~$ python'''

this will start a Python instance, and everything else you type in the terminal window will be treated as Python.

**Linux**

This depends on the Linux distribution you're using, but it will most likely be installed. 

## Text Editors

There are quite a few to choose from, but some of the most popular include-

* [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/)(Mac, Windows, Linux)

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)(Mac, Windows, Linux)

* If you're using Windows, [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is a great option.

* Experienced programmers might enjoy [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or [Vim](http://www.vim.org/index.php)
